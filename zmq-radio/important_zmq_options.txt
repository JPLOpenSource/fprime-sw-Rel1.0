ZMQ Socket Options
ZMQ 3.2.6

ZMQ_RCVTIMEO: Set receive timeout
ZMQ_SNDTIMEO: Set send timeout




ZMQ_SNDHWM: Set high water mark for outbound messages
ZMQ_RCVHWM: Set high water mark for inbound messages

"The high water mark is a hard limit on the maximum number of outstanding 
messages Ã˜MQ shall queue in memory"


ZMQ_IDENTITY: Set socket identity

"The ZMQ_IDENTITY option shall set the identity of the specified socket when 
connecting to a ROUTER socket. The identity should be from 1 to 255 bytes 
long and MAY NOT start with binary zero."


ZMQ_SNDBUF: Set kernel transmit buffer size
ZMQ_RCVBUF: Set kernel receive buffer size

"Set the underlying kernel transmit/receive buffer size for the socket to the specified 
size in bytes. A value of zero means leave the OS default unchanged. For details please 
refer to your operating system documentation for the SO_SNDBUF socket option."
Socket shutdown linger period

ZMQ_LINGER

"The ZMQ_LINGER option shall set the linger period for the specified socket. The linger period 
determines how long pending messages which have yet to be sent to a peer shall linger in memory 
after a socket is closed with zmq_close(3)"

"The default value of -1 specifies an infinite linger period. Pending messages shall not be discarded 
after a call to zmq_close(); attempting to terminate the socket's context with zmq_term() shall block 
until all pending messages have been sent to a peer.

The value of 0 specifies no linger period. Pending messages shall be discarded immediately when the 
socket is closed with zmq_close(). Positive values specify an upper bound for the linger period in 
milliseconds."
